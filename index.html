      <h2>why university tees?</h2>
      <p>University Tees was founded in 2003 by two students at Miami University, Nick Dadas and Hoe Haddad. They had difficulty trying to organize a t-shirt order and figured there was a better way. Therefore, they started University Tees with one
        simple vision in mind: to create the best custom apparel experience the collegiate market had ever seen.</p>
